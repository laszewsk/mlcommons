# What is this backup?
This is a backup of greene_v0.5 directory as of Oct 2023 on NYU HPC Greene. As Greene access expires, we save this backup as the final working version that records all previous works done by NYU team and later work by Gregor von Laszewski and Ruochen Gu. This is also the version of cloudmask with which we produced results running on Greene.

# What's in it?
* Adaption to Singularity with overlay
* Supporting documents (e.g. README-greene_v0.5, etc.)
* Bash scripts done by NYU team (e.g. reproduce_experiments.sh)
* Improved Bash scripts (e.g. GRCtest_reproduce_experiments.sh)
* Auxiliary Bash scripts (e.g. archive_outputs.sh, clean_outputs.sh, etc.)
