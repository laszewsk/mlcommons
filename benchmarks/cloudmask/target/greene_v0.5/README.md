# Benchmarking on NYU HPC Greene Cluster

## Pre-requisite
Before installing on Greene HPC:

1. Renew or request for a [NYU HPC 
Account](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/research-computing-services/high-performance-computing/high-performance-computing-nyu-it/hpc-accounts-and-eligibility.html).
2. Set up SSH keys for your github account. 



## Set-up Git

```bash
greene> 
  git config pull.rebase false
  git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
  git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
  git config --global core.editor "nano"
```

## Get Interactive node and login

```bash
greene> 
  srun --gres=gpu:v100:1 --pty --mem=64G --time 02:00:00 /bin/bash
```

## Generating Experiment Configurations

All bash terminal lines that are to be executed on the interactive node start with "node>".

```bash
node> 
  # export USER_SCRATCH=/scratch/$USER/github

  export USER_SCRATCH=/scratch/$USER/github
  export PROJECT_DIR=$USER_SCRATCH/mlcommons/benchmarks/cloudmask
  export PROJECT_DATA=$USER_SCRATCH/data
  export TARGET=$PROJECT_DIR/target/greene_v0.5
  
  mkdir -p $USER_SCRATCH
  mkdir -p $PROJECT_DATA
  cd $USER_SCRATCH

  git clone https://github.com/laszewsk/mlcommons.git
  # git clone https://github.com/VarshithaChennamsetti/mlcommons.git
  # git clone https://github.com/rg3515/mlcommons.git

  cd $PROJECT_DIR
```

## Set-up Python

```bash
node> 
  module purge

  # on greene node
  module load anaconda3/2020.07
  module load cudnn/8.6.0.163-cuda11
  
  # module load python/intel/3.8.6
  
  # on rivanna node 
  #   module load anaconda/2020.11-py3.8
  #   module load cudnn/8.2.4.15

  time conda create -p $USER_SCRATCH/python310 python=3.10 -y

  # TODO: write down the time iit takes
  # greene:
  # rivanna:  2m10.665s
  
  source activate $USER_SCRATCH/python310
  time python3 -m venv $USER_SCRATCH/ENV3
  # greene:
  # rivanna: real	0m5.526s
  
  conda deactivate

  source $USER_SCRATCH/ENV3/bin/activate

  pip install pip -U
  which python
```

This should return $USER_SCRATCH/ENV3/bin/python

From now on you only have to do 

```bash
source $USER_SCRATCH/ENV3/bin/activate
```

If you need a new terminal or login again into a node.


Make sure to change the paths in the 'config.yaml' file to appropriate locations. The paths for 'train_dir', 'inference_dir', 'model_file', 'output_dir' and 'venvpath' must be fixed based on the user's directory.

```bash
node> 
  cd $TARGET
  time make requirements

  # greene:
  # rivanna: real	2m2.626s
```

## Obtain the data

```bash
node> 
  time make data
```

This command takes about 1hr to execute.

## Run the code


```bash
greene> 
  cd $TARGET
  mkdir -p outputs
  sbatch simple.slurm
  squeue -u $USER
```

## Reproduce Experiments

This will create multiple copies of config_simple.yaml, simple.slurm and the output log files.

```bash
greene> 
  bash reproduce_experiments.sh
```

## Visualize results

To visualize the graphs, pass the paths to the log files as the arguments while running the file visualizer.py. You can pass along a single experiment log files or combine all of them and then pass them as inputs.

```bash
greene>
  cat cloudmask_200* >> cloudmask_200.log
  cat mlperf_cloudmask_200* >> mlperf_cloudmask_200.log
  python3 visualizer.py mlperf_cloudmask_200.log cloudmask_200.log
```

## Killing all jobs

To kill all jobs in the queue, please use

```bash
greene>
    squeue -u $USER -h | awk '{print $1}' | xargs scancel
```

# Parameterized jobs for rivanna with cloudmesh-sbatch

This version of cloudmask uses [cloudmesh-sbatch](https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-sbatch) 
to coordinate a parameter sweep over hyperparameters. It significantly simplifies managing
different experiments as it stores the output in a directory format that 
simplifies analysis.




## 1. Programming Environment Prerequisites

### 1.1 LaTeX (optional)

We assume if you like to use the automated report generated (under
development) you have full version of latex installed

```bash
module load texlive
```

If you do not want to create the reports, please skip this step.

### 1.2 Python 3

We assume you have a fairly new version of Python installed susch as 
Python 3.10.8. However, a version greater than 3.10.4 will also do.
We install the version of python to be used in a python venv and 
install in it the required packages. Please note that as of
Dec 2022, python 3.11 is not supported by anaconda which we 
use for this project as it is the recommended version by the 
rivanna support staff.

If you have executed this step previously, you only have to say 

```bash
source ~/ENV3/bin/activate
```

Otherwise, do the following:

```bash
module purge
module load anaconda

conda create -y -n python310 python=3.10
source activate python310

python -m venv ~/ENV3
source ~/ENV3/bin/activate
mkdir ~/cm
cd ~/cm
pip install cloudmesh-installer
cloudmesh-installer get sbatch
cms help
```

In either case your command promt will have the prefix `(ENV3)`.

Note that we use two different python environment. 
One for running sbatch, the other in whcih we run tensorflow, which will be 
setup automatically in a later step.


## 2. Generating experiment configurations

Choose a PROJECT_DIR where you like to install the code. Rivanna offers some temporary
space in the /scratch directory. 

```bash
export PROJECT_DIR=/scratch/$USER
mkdir -p ${PROJECT_DIR}
cd ${PROJECT_DIR}
git clone ssh://git@github.com/laszewsk/mlcommons.git
cd mlcommons/benchmarks/cloudmask/target/rivanna
```
## 3. Obtaining the data

Next we obtain the data. The command uses an aws call to download both
daytime and nighttime images of the sky. The total space the data dir
will take up is 180GB. It will take around 20 minutes to finish downloading
the data. In case the data was previously downloaded, this stepp will take 15 
seconds.


```bash
time make data
```

The data is downloaded to 

```
$(PROJECT_DIR)/mlcommons/benchmarks/cloudmask/data
```

## 4. Generate parameterized jobs

Next we generate some parameterized jobs. These runs are controlled with two files.

* `config.yaml` -- Specifies the parameters for cloudmask and the 
  SLURM scripts.

* `ubuntu.in.slurm` -- Specifies the slurm script in which the parameters 
  defined by `config.yaml` will be substituted.

  This is simply done via the following make commands after you have selected 
  appropriate values in the yaml file. 

  ```bash
  # setup venv
  make setup  # this takes minutes 
  make project # this takes less then 15 seconds
  ```

  The makefile targets will generate two files and a subdirectory with individual 
  experiments:

* `project.sh` -- Is a file that contains each individual job submission 
  based on the parameter sweep that is defined by the YAML file.
* `project.json` -- Is a file that contains the metadata associated with the 
  individual job submissions generated from the experiment permutations
* `project` -- Is a directory that includes for each individual experiment a 
  slurm script and a yaml file.

## 5. Running the parameterized jobs

Before executing the `jobs-project.sh` script, it is advised that you inspect the 
output of the files and directories. 

Be aware that many jobs may take hours to complete.  We provide here a simple 
estimate while using some predefined model as specified in our yaml file.

| Epochs | Time in s |    Time |
|-------:|----------:|--------:|
|      1 |       900 | 15m 00s |
|     10 |      2667 | 44m 27s |
|     30 |       ??? |     ??? |
|     50 |       ??? |     ??? |
|    100 |       ??? |     ??? |

An example on how to look at a slurm script (assuming we use an a100 in the YAML file) is 

```bash
less project/card_name_a100_gpu_count_1_cpu_num_1_mem_64GB_repeat_1_epoch_10/rivanna.slurm
```

To look at the yaml file for this experiment, use 

```bash
less project/card_name_a100_gpu_count_1_cpu_num_1_mem_64GB_repeat_1_epoch_10/config.yaml
```

or simply call  which uses emacs to open both files from the firts parameterized job.

```bash
make inspect
```

Note: to exit emacs, press `Ctrl+x` and then `Ctrl+c` to return to your normal prompt.

## 6. Running the experiments

If all the output from above looks correct, you can execute the jobs
by running the last two scripts that are generated by cms sbatch
generate submit.

```bash
make run
# Submitted batch job 12345678
```

The number will be different for you.

To find out the status you can do the following commands. The first
looks up the job by the id, the second will list all jobs you
submitted. if you just have one job it will return just that one
job. `make status` is a shortcut to see all jobs of a user.

```bash
make status
```


The `make run` will submit the job to slurm, and the
notebook file will be outputted in the
`$(pwd)/cloudmask/<experiment_id>` directory.

You can see the progress of each job by inspecting the `*.out` and
`*.error` files located in the `$(pwd)/cloudmask/<experiment_id>`). 
The following log files will be created:

* `cloudmask-%j.log` -- Output created by SLURM from whole job.in.slurm script.
* `cloudmask-%j.error` -- Error messages caught by SLURM when either the job 
   writes to stderr, or an error is caught by SLURM.
* `gpu0.log` -- Logfile with Temperatures and energy values for the GPU0. This 
   assumes you run the code on the GPU with number 0.
* `mlperf_cloudmask.log` -- Logfile that records all MLCommons logging events.
* `cloudmask_run.log` --  Logfile for recording runtimes.
* `output.log` -- Logfile that covers all the output of the `slstr_cloud.py` file.

To watch the output dynamically for an example run you can use the command 

```bash
tail -f  project/card_name_a100_gpu_count_1_cpu_num_6_mem_64GB_TFTTransformerepochs_2/*.out
```

you will have to change the second parameter in the path according to your 
hyperparameters and what you like to watch 

The file `output.log` contains a convenient human readable summary of the various portions of the program execution generated with cloudmesh StopWatch. It includes details of the compute node, as well as runtimes.

for further automated processing.


## 7. Generate Report

**TODO:** not implemented

```bash
pdflatex report.tex
pdflatex report.tex
# bibtex report.bib
pdflatex report.tex
```

This will create a pdf named `report.pdf`.  You can download this to
your local to view the output to view the report generated as a result
of the execution.
