## Mission

Evaluate, Organize, Curate, and Integrate artifacts around Applications, 
Models(algorithms), Infrastructure, and the 3 MLCommons Pillars Benchmarks, 
Datasets, and Best Practices. These artifacts are open source and accessible 
through the MLCommons GitHub. Our input comes from independently funded a
ctivities and experts in Industry, Government, and Research.

This includes the folowing activities.

Encourage and support the curation of large-scale experimental and
scientific datasets and the engineering of ML benchmarks operating on
those datasets. The WG will engage with scientists, academics,
and national laboratories, such as synchrotrons, in securing, engineering,
curating, and publishing datasets and machine learning benchmarks that
operate on experimental scientific datasets. This will entail working
across different domains of sciences, including material, life,
environmental, and earth sciences, particle physics, and astronomy, to
mention a few. We will include traditional observational and
computer-generated data.

Although scientific data is widespread, curating, maintaining, and
distributing large-scale, useful datasets for public consumption is a
challenging process, covering various aspects of data (from FAIR
principles to distribution to versioning). With large data products,
various ML techniques have to be evaluated against different
architectures and different datasets. Without these benchmarking
efforts, the community has no clear pathway for utilizing these
advanced models. We expect that the collection will have significant
tutorial value as examples from one field, and one observational or
computational experiment can be modified to advance other fields and
experiments.

The working group’s goal is to assemble and distribute scientific data
sets relevant to a scientific campaign in a systematic manner, and
pose quantifiable targets (“science benchmark"). A benchmark involves
(i) a data set, (ii) objective criteria to meet, and (iii) an example
implementation. The objective criteria depends on the scientific
problem at hand. The metric should be well defined on the data but
could come from a diverse set of measures (one or more of: accuracy
targets, top-1 or 5% error, time to convergence, cross-validation
rates, confusion matrices, type-1/type-2 error rates, inference times,
surrogate accuracy, control stability measure, etc.).  Although we compile system performance numbers across a variety of architectures, our goal is not performance measurements but rather improving scientific discovery performance.
